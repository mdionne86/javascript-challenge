# javascript-challenge
Greetings true believers! This was an interesting assignment that was a nice reprieve after last week!

### Tools Used
JS, CSS, and HTML

### Code Notes
Working in order of what needed to happen first:

1. Wrote code to load the initial table
2. Captured input click and data
3. Filtered the table

BONUS: I added a warning message if you click filter without entering any data.
